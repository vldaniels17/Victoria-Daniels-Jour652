    <p> From understanding consent to the process of reporting sexual assault, the University of Maryland is working to re-shape awareness, prevention and education when it comes to sexual assault. </p>

<p class="chapter"> What is Consent? </p>
<p class="body">"Consent is a mutual and non-coerced agreement between participants of a sexual encounter. Consent does not always have to be verbal communication but that can help clearly define boundaries” said an anonymous graduate student in a survey conducted about consent. </p>

<p class="body">Many other survey participants agreed that consent is mutual and gives permission. Yet, even with knowing what consent is, it’s important to understand how far consent goes into the act of intimacy.</p>

<p class="body">On Thursday, November 21, UMD’s Student Government Association hosted Reclaim the Red: Moving Forward, an event geared towards the conversation of sexual assault awareness. Grace Fansler, prevention and education program coordinator at the Maryland Coalition Against Sexual Assault, gave a presentation that covered everything from consent to the presence of alochol in sexual assault situations.</p>
<blockquote> "Consent is a continual conversation" -Fansler </blockquote>
<p class="body">“Consent is a continual conversation,” Fansler said as she spoke to the necessary boundaries that each party should establish and respect during intimate situations.</p>

<h2>Verbal Consent before Sexual Activity</h2>
<h3> Students responded whether or not they give verbal consent each time before engaging in sexual activity</h3>

<!-- END fisrt graphic container-->
</p>

<p class="body">During the survey 95% of the participants said that consent can be revoked at any point during sex, while 5% said that it cannot be revoked. Here lies a problem. Fansler stated that consent is continuous, meaning that at any point during intimacy, a party can revoke consent and wish to stop the interaction. </p>

<p class="body">This same lack of knowledge on the timeline of consent is what Maya Dayanim, an e-board member of Preventing Sexual Assault, believes is the main issue when it comes to sexual assault on college campuses.</p>

<p class="body">“It’s more of a passive choice not to ask for it,” said Dayanim and thats why PSA, the first and only student-ran organization on campus dedicated to sexual assault, strives to promote awareness through education. </p>

<p class="body">Students in the survey had varied answers when asked do they verbally consent each time before engaging in sexual activity, with the majority saying that they do not verbally consent. </p>

   <p class="chapter"> Peer to Peer Advocacy </p>

   <p class="body"> As the data reflects, there is a grey area when it comes to students understanding the fundamentals and principles of consent. That’s why Campus Advocates Respond and Educate to Stop Violence have created two workshops dedicated to tackling this tough topic. </p>

  <p class="body"> As listed on their website, CARE to Stop Violence provides free, confidential advocacy and therapy services to primary and secondary survivors of sexual assault, relationship violence, stalking and sexual harrassment. With this advocacy comes workshops, presentations and outreach activities. </p>

  <p class="body"> “The C Word is Consent” focuses on deconstructing common rape myths and defining consent, coercion and victim-blaming said Max Balagtas-Badoy, program management specialist for CARE to Stop Violence. This workshop has been held 14 times this year and has reached 638 participants. </p>

   <p class="body"> The second workshop targets the the athletic community at UMD."Consent and Communications" works on bridging the gap between consent and communication. This newer workshop has reached 17 teams and a total of 450 student athletes so far. </p>

   <p class="body"> The “by students, for students” method of these workshops falls directly in the goals of this organization as they strive for student to student advocacy. CARE is a confidential resource meaning that students can seek help related to incidents without it being reported to UMPD or the Office of Civil Rights and Sexual Misconduct. </p>

<blockquote> "We do not force or pressure anyone to take specific steps" - Balagtas-Body </blockquote>

  <p class="body"> “One of the most significant benefits of using a service like CARE is our ability to maintain confidentiality” said Balagtas-Badoy. “We do not force or pressure anyone to take specific steps.” </p>

  <p class="body"> Staff is only required to report incidents of childhood sexual abuse or anything that is in an immediate threat to safety, otherwise the advocates and therapists are dedicated to hearing survivors and helping them heal in whatever way that survivor needs. Balagtas-Badoy says that a helpful part of the healing process is “allowing survivors to regain power and control over their situation can be very helpful for healing process.” </p>

     <p class="chapter"> Administrative Help </p>

     <p class="body">The Office of Civil Rights and Sexual Misconduct is another entity on campus that works with sexual assault. They are responsible for overseeing and implementing the University’s compliance with Title IX, federal and state civil rights laws and regulations, according to a statement from the office. </p>

    <p class="body"> OCRSM declined an interview request and only provided a blanket statement via email in response to detailed questions. </p>

     <p class="body"> “OCRSM oversees the University’s response to all reports of sexual misconduct made in connection with University-sponsored programs and activities involving members of the University community-when the sexual misconduct impedes equal access to any education program or activity or adversely impacts the education or employment of a community member, regardless of where the conduct occurred; and/or that otherwise threatens the health and/or safety of a member of the campus community” </p>

    <p class="body"> In addition to the statement, they sent a pdf outlining the student sexual misconduct complaint process. </p>

    <img src="complaint.png" class="complaint">
    <p class="caption"> Picture courtesy of OCRSM </p>

    <p class="body"> They also included their 2017-2018 report Student Sexual Misconduct Report which includes student data on sexual misconduct complaints and ongoing sexual misconduct prevention and education on campus, as said on the overview page in the report. </p>

    <p class="body"> While implementing campus-wide civil rights compliance training and mandatory sexual misconduct training for everyone, the office “strives to foster an inclusive campus.” </p>

       <p class="caption"> Photo courtesy of UMPD </p>
    <p class="body">While students have the choice to report administratively to CARE and OCRSM, they can also file a criminal investigation with the University of Maryland Police Department, according to Sgt. Rosanne Hoaas, public information officer for UMPD. </p>

    <p class="body"> Sgt. Hoaas described the department’s reaction to reports as an “immediate response as the criminal investigation unit is automatically notified.</p>

    <p class="body">“You could come in the middle of the night, you’re going to get an officer to meet with you, “ said Hoaas. This means survivors can contact UMPD at any time during the day or even and expect someone to immediately meet with them or begin to hear their story.</p>

    <p class="body"> Survivors can report incidents that have happened at any time. According to Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network, Maryland has no statute of limitations for any felony sex crime. This holds true as the Uniform Crime Report on UMPD’s website lists two rapes for 2019, with one of them occurring in August but being reported just last month in November.</p>

        <blockquote> "That's the message here, it's the survivor's choice" - Hoaas. </blockquote>
      <p class="body">  UMPD gives survivors the option of having a Sexual Assault Forensic Examination performed by the local hospitals. The <a class="intextlinks" href="https://mcasa.org/survivors/getting-medical-attention">Maryland Coalition Against Sexual Assault’s website</a> details the exact procedures during a SAFE exam and the hospitals that offer this service, free of charge.  </p>

      <p class="body">
      UMPD also grants people the ability to stop, start or pause the investigation at any moment. If the survivor decides they want the investigation to continue, UMPD sends the case to the Prince George’s County State Attorney’s Office to see if they can prosecute further. The office will decide whether there is enough information to move forward or whether information still needs to be gathered.</p>

    <p class="body">
    "That's the message here, it's the survivor's choice," said Hoaas. A key part of the officer’s end of the investigation is respecting the survivor’s wishes throughout whether that be wanting a SAFE exam or stopping the investigation. UMPD even allows for victim advocates to be present during this process to help the survivor tell their story. </p>

   <p class="body">  The only requirement that the police department has is to report to Title IX, a mandatory procedure if survivors approach UMPD. If survivors go to Title IX or CARE, they are not obligated to report to UMPD. If the survivor wishes to file a criminal investigation after seeing Title IX and CARE, those offices contact UMPD and the process begins.</p>

      <p class="chapter"> Student Resolutions </p>

    <p class="body">  Students were also asked in the survey to include their thoughts on solutions for stopping sexual assault and bringing more awareness to the subject. All of the responses focused on more education and outreach, more police action and more safe spaces. Many students also included that UMD’s campus could benefit from ending the stigma attached to sexual assault.</p>

    <p class="body">  CARE has a crisis hotline, 301-741-3442 which is accessible 24 hours and students can also text the UMPD dispatcher or use the Guardian app to report incidents. For more information on each of the entities mentioned in the story, please follow the links below. </p>
